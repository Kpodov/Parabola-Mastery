# Mostly my dotfiles for ricing

This contains the config files of the programs I mainly use on my GNU/Linux machine. And they are universal, so you can use them on any GNU/Linux distros as long as you have the corresponding dependencies installed.

## Programs:

* i3: a tiling window manager for Linux
