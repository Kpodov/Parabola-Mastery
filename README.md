# Mostly my dotfiles for ricing

Parabola is a GNU/Linux-libre operating system.:
* It's the free (as freedom -libre) derivative of Archlinux 
* It's simple and lightweight. 


This contains the config/scripts files of the programs I mainly use on my GNU/Linux machine. And they are universal, so you can use them on any GNU/Linux distros as long as you have the corresponding dependencies installed.

## Programs:

* i3:    	a tiling window manager for Linux
* Polybar:	customizable status bar used with i3 
* Ranger: 	CLI file manager with VI key bindings
* The Systetm doc contains bash scripts that keeps 
Parabola up to date
* ncmpcpp is a mpd client: for playing music from the terminal!
* Music Player Daemon: a server-client audio player:
	* plays audio; organizes playlists and maintains your music database  
	* Required by ncmpcpp
